# GitHub Actions Assignment 3

This repository contains the code and configuration files for the GitHub Actions Assignment 3.

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions Assignment 3 focuses on running Scala code using GitHub Actions. The workflow is designed to automate the execution of the Scala code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GitHub Actions Assignment 3, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
              
         git clone https://github.com/shivamknoldus1869/Github_Actions_Assignment_3_Shivam.git

2. Set up the required environment and tools for running the Scala code. This may include installing Java and sbt.

3. Customize the Scala code to suit your needs. Modify the code in the main class (`DiamondPattern`) to generate the desired output.

4. Review and update the `.github/workflows/sbt-ci.yaml` file to configure the GitHub Actions workflow. Ensure that the correct name of the main class is specified in the `Run Scala Code` step.

5. Open the project in your preferred code editor to make any necessary modifications.

6. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.

## Running the Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow will be automatically triggered on every push to the `main` branch. It will build the project and run the Scala code.

## Manual Run

If you want to manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and run the Scala code, follow these steps:

1. Go to the main page of your GitHub repository.

2. Click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository.

3. In the left sidebar, click on the workflow name (e.g., "Scala Workflow").

4. Click on the "Run workflow" button.

5. Select the branch you want to run the workflow on(but no need for this).

6. Click on the "Run workflow" button to start the manual run.

7. Monitor the progress of the workflow in the GitHub Actions interface.
